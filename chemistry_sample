Math Concepts for StudyMate:

1. Algebra:
   - Solving equations: 2x + 5 = 15 -> x = 5
   - Quadratic equations: ax^2 + bx + c = 0

2. Geometry:
   - Area of circle: A = pi * r^2
   - Perimeter of rectangle: P = 2 * (l + w)

3. Trigonometry:
   - sin(theta), cos(theta), tan(theta)
   - Pythagoras theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2

4. Calculus:
   - Derivative of f(x) = x^2 -> f'(x) = 2x
   - Integral of f(x) = 2x -> x^2 + C

5. Probability:
   - P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total outcomes

This PDF is created for testing StudyMate's PDF-based Q&A system.
